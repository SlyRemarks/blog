### Bothy Old

Floor area: 21.04 m2

**Walls: 60.39 W/K**

0.85m Thick stone walls, plaster on hard.

In the mid-terrace energy assessment I discuss [U-values of stone walls](http://trystanlea@org.uk/energyassessment) and choose a mid-range U-value of 1.7 W/K.m2, understanding that I might expect a range of U-values from 1.3 W/K.m2 up to 2.1 W/K.m2. 

The stone walls for the bothy are thicker than the mid-terrace house at 0.85m rather than 0.55m. 1.7 W/K.m2 corresponds to a thermal conductivity of 0.935 W/K.m which would result in a U-value of 1.1 W/K.m2 at a wall thickness of 0.85 m. Im far from confident in the accuracy of this figure for the walls but will use it as a starting point.

Front wall

- Length: 5.46m, Height: 2.36m, Depth: 0.85m
- Gross Area: 12.9 m2, Openings: 3.4 m2, Net Area: 9.5 m2
- U-value: 1.1 W/K.m2, Heatloss: 10.45 W/K

Rear wall - *the following calculation does not take into account that the bothy is built into the bank*.

- Length: 5.46m, Height: 2.36m, Depth: 0.85m
- Gross Area: 12.9 m2, Openings: 0.0 m2, Net Area: 12.9 m2
- U-value: 1.1 W/K.m2, Heatloss: 14.19 W/K

Left wall (external) - *this wall contains a complicated deep fireplace detail, its also full height to the roof.*

- Length: 1.93+1.3+2.02+1.3+1.93 = 8.48 m, Average height: 3.36m, Depth: 0.85m
- Gross Area: 28.5 m2, Openings: 0.0 m2, Net Area: 28.5 m2
- U-value: 1.1 W/K.m2, Heatloss: 31.35 W/K

Right wall (partial party) 

- Length: 3.95m, Average height: 3.36m, Depth: 0.85m
- Gross Area: 13.3 m2, Door: 1.4 m2, Net Area: 11.9 m2

The wall between both parts of the bothy is part external and part party wall, the Lab part is smaller in size. The difference in external area is 18.19 m2 - 12.68 m2 = 5.51 m2 (30%). Applying this 70/30 ratio to the internal area and assuming a door with a similar U-value to the wall for now, not too far off an assumtion, results in an approximate external area of 4.0m2 and party wall of 9.3m2.

- U-value: 1.1 W/K.m2 x 4.0 m2 = Heatloss: 4.4 W/K

Adding these all together we arrive at a total external wall heat loss of 60.39 W/K.

**Floor: 14.58 W/K**

Solid slate floor, uninsulated, partial carpet, 21.04 m2.

Using the [Carbon Coop Open Floor U-value Calculator](https://openflooruvaluecalculator.carbon.coop/) with: slab on ground, area:21.04, perimiter:17.47, ground:clay or silt, thickness of external walls:0.85, insulation:none. Results in a U-value of 0.693 W/K.m2 and a heat loss rate of 14.58 W/K

**Roof: 15.3 W/K**

The gross roof area is 2x 2.46m x 5.46m = 26.86 m2. There are two windows 0.51 m2 and 0.76 m2, giving a net roof area of 25.6 m2.

The roof is insulated with ~100mm of rockwool between timber battons. Timber battons are at ~440mm spacing and 60mm thick. As a rough estimate 60/440 = 13.6% wood, 86% rockwool insulation. 

The thermal conductivity of rockwool is 0.044 W/mK and so the U-value at 100mm would be 0.44 W/K.m2 and the thermal conductivity of timber is typically between 0.12 and 0.20 W/mK, assuming 0.16 W/mK would result in a U-value of 1.6 W/K.m2 at 100mm.

Area of wood 25.6m2 x 0.136 = 3.5 m2 x 1.6 W/K.m2 = 5.6 W/K<br>
Area of rockwool 25.6m2 x 0.864 = 22.1 m2 x 0.44 W/K.m2 = 9.7 W/K<br>
Total roof heat loss = 15.3 W/K

The combined U-value of the wood and rockwool is 0.6 W/K.m2.

**Windows & Doors: 12.16 W/K**

Secondary glazed windows

- Window 1, Southeast, secondary glazing, 0.87 x 1.04 = 0.9 m2
- Window 2, Southeast, secondary glazing, 0.87 x 1.04 = 0.9 m2
- Roof Window, Southeast, 4 double glazing units, 4 x 0.31 x 0.41 = 0.51 m2
- Roof Window, Northwest, 5 double glazing units, 5 x 0.37 x 0.41 = 0.76 m2
- Door, Southeast, 0.82 x 1.92 = 1.6 m2

Assuming secondary glazing U-values of 2.8 W/K.m2, window 1 and 2 results in a heat loss of 5.04 W/K.m2.

Assuming a double glazing U-value of 1.6 W/K.m2, 2.0 W/K.

- Door: 3.2 W/K.m2 x 1.6 = 5.12 W/K

Total: 12.16 W/K

**Air-tightness: ~30 W/K**

Surface area: 115.5 m2, Volume: 70.7 m3

Calculating air-change per hour at 10 and 20 m3/hr/m2@50Pa:

- 10 m3/hr/m2@50Pa x 115.5 m2 = 1155 m3/hr @50Pa / 70.7 m3 = 16.3 ACH @50Pa
- 20 m3/hr/m2@50Pa x 115.5 m2 = 2310 m3/hr @50Pa / 70.7 m3 = 32.7 ACH @50Pa

The SAP calculation uses the q50/20 rule of thumb in order to calculate the background ventilation rate.

- 16.3 ACH @50Pa / 20 = 0.82 ACH
- 32.7 ACH @50Pa / 20 = 1.63 ACH
    
Calculating heat loss:

- heat loss @ 0.82 ACH = 1000 kg/m3 x 1.225 J/kg/K x 0.82 ACH x 70.7 m3 / 3600 = 19.7 W/K
- heat loss @ 1.63 ACH = 1000 kg/m3 x 1.225 J/kg/K x 1.63 ACH x 70.7 m3 / 3600 = 39.2 W/K

**Total: 142 W/K**

Target temperature 18C at 0C outside, suggests ~2.5 kW heat input requirement, increasing to 3.4 kW at standard 21C and -3C outside. Heatpump radiator design would be designed to work alongside wood stove and so the lower target would I think be acceptable.

- Length: 3.35m, Average height: 2.7m
- Gross Area: 9.0 m2, Door: 1.7 m2, Net Area: 7.3 m2

The wall is a similar thickness, timber and insulation constitution to the roof calculated above. Assuming a similar U-value of 0.6 W/K.m2.

- U-value: 0.66 W/K.m2, Heatloss: 4.4 W/K

**Floor: 15.0 W/K**

Solid floor, concrete slab, uninsulated with carpet, 20.5 m2.

Using the [Carbon Coop Open Floor U-value Calculator](https://openflooruvaluecalculator.carbon.coop/) with: slab on ground, area:20.5, perimiter:15.45, ground:clay or silt, thickness of external walls:0.85, insulation:none. Results in a U-value of 0.731 W/K.m2 and a heat loss rate of 14.99 W/K

**Roof: 15.6 W/K**

- Roof area: 2x 2.37m x 6.05m = 28.68 m2
- Windows: 1.02+0.88+0.37+0.37 = 2.64 m2

- Total: 6.54 W/K

**Air-tightness: 28.1 W/K**

Surface area: 82.4 m2, Volume: 54.7 m3

- 20 m3/hr/m2@50Pa x 82.4 m2 = 1648 m3/hr @50Pa / 54.7 m3 = 30.1 ACH @50Pa
- 30.1 ACH @50Pa / 20 = 1.51 ACH
- heat loss @ 1.51 ACH = 1000 kg/m3 x 1.225 J/kg/K x 1.51 ACH x 54.7 m3 / 3600 = 28.1 W/K

**Total: 99.5 W/K**

Target temperature 18C at 0C outside, suggests ~1.8 kW heat input requirement, increasing to 2.4 kW at standard 21C and -3C outside. Heatpump is the only contributor to space heating in this room.

A total heat loss rate of 99.5 W/K is very similar to the value that I calculated previously using SAP of 101W/K in winter, 95W/K in summer. Monitoring results suggested potentially better performance at 85 W/K +- 24% (65-103 W/K).
