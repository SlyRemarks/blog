## title: A thought experiment (outline draft)
### published: 2018-06-03

Imagine you have a pristine natural environment without human intervention, perhaps it has a mixture of habitats, a forest, a number of rivers, wetlands, grasslands, a lake, sea, mountains on the horizon. The area is teaming with wildlife, birds, insects, bees, small mammals, beavers, larger animals, fish. Its a beautiful, wild place with a comfortable climate, rich soil content, and even mineral deposits: copper, bauxite, iron, silica and rare earth’s.

Now imagine that you have a village, or small town worth of people 2,400 people in 1000 ‘households’. There are 9000m2 of land per household, 3750m2 per person, roughly equivalent to the land area per person in the UK today. This land covers all habitats and land types in our hypothetical thought experiment. Imagine to begin with that these 2,400 people have just arrived and have not yet modified the landscape in any way.

Lets say our weary travellers value the rest of nature around them highly and have a wish to minimise their impact as far as possible. Imagine being one of them every decision you make you are keen to consider carefully the balance between your impact and your value of the wild place you inhabit and its own right to existence. 

At the same time the weather can get quite cold and rainy and if you don’t eat things wont go particularly well...

Lets imagine that the first task is to source, grow enough food to eat...

1. zcb food and diets, land use model, explore implications on biodiversity of different dietary choices. How much of the land gets used up?...

2. shelter and biomass heat, land area implications, timber, hemp

… explore increasing the level of technology to ‘modern’ levels in stages … what are the implications on land use, biodiversity 

### An outline first attempt

#### 1. Food

Starting with food. What if our hypothetical village choose to eat a diet similar to the average UK diet today? What would the land use implication of this be? How much of the wild land would we convert to arable and pasture? Its an incredibly complex topic of course, The ZeroCarbonBritain report provides a useful analysis that I will use as a first pass on this topic.

The Land Use chapter starting page 81 of the Zero Carbon Britain: Rethinking the Future report documents the following land use requirements for our diets today as well as what the potential land use could be if we changed our diets.

<table class="table">
<tr><th>Today</th><th>Zero Carbon Britain Scenario</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>78% UK land used for arable and livestock farming</li>

<li>no imported livestock products or feed for livestock</li>
</ul>

These figures suggest that if our village or small town's worth of people where to try to replicate our diets today while being self sufficient, the land area would likely exceed the land available. There would be no wild land left. The ZeroCarbonBritain scenario on the other hand suggests that we can grow 83% of our food on 34% of our land area (which would increase to 41% if imported foods where included and land intensities where similar).

Growing and processing food requires more inputs than direct crop/livestock land area alone, especially so where synthetic fertilizers, tractors and other farm machinery are used. Lets assume for now that our villagers or perhaps small-holders? take a labour-intensive approach. 

**The ZeroCarbonBritain Diet:** follows the recommendations for a healthy diet provided by the government including: a minimum of five portions of fruit and vegetables per day. About a third of the diet made up of starchy foods, no more than 10% of daily kcal intake made up of unhealthy foods high in fats, sugar and salt. No more than 70g of red and processed meats eaten per day.

Every person, on average eats about 2,280 kcal per day. Most of the energy comes from starchy foods like pasta, rice and potatoes and protein needs come from a weekly combination of:

- One large portion of read meat per week (a steak, pork or lamb chop, a portion of liver or a chicken fillet).
- Two further smaller portions of pig or chicken per week (for example, two rashers of bacon or a few slices of chicken).
- A fillet of fish
- One portion of meat alternatives, such as tofu.
- Four portions of pulses (such as lentils, chickpeas and baked beans).
- Two eggs.
- Enough milk to cover breakfast cereal and cups of tea and coffee (with additional milk coming from alternatives, such as soya).
- A small portion of cheese and yoghurt.

**Biodiversity?**

The ZeroCarbonBritain food scenario is a relatively intensive scenario, with high yields, it is a mixed organic and conventional agriculture. Researching organic yields suggests reduced yields compared with conventional agriculture, lower yields means a larger land area is required to produce the same amount of food. A larger land area means more wild land converted for agricultural use. There are many studies suggesting that organic agriculture has a higher biodiversity than conventional agriculture, the difference may result from a variety of factors from pesticide use to the degree of 'land-sharing' where biodiversity habitat is mixed in with agricultural land e.g verges on the edge of fields & hedges. A portion of the yield reduction on organic agriculture is because insects, birds and other animals eat some of the crops, which of course in turn also means that you support more insects, birds and other animals. Does a high yielding agriculture with all produce extracted for human consumption necessarily mean reduced biodiversity because that nutritional benefit is not available for other life?

Is there any difference in overall biodiversity between a lower yielding organic agriculture with higher biodiversity but greater land use and so reduction in wild land - or a higher yielding, less biodiverse agriculture mirrored by a larger amount of wild land?

Another dimension to this question is the downstream effect of fertilizer and pesticide run-off, or soil loss due to erosion, there is potentially a detrimental effect that is wider than the agricultural area that could affect wild areas beyond the farm boundary.

This is a complex topic I wish to understand in more detail. The following papers and articles give an idea of the complexity of this topic:

#### 2. Shelter & Warmth

Alongside food and water, shelter is perhaps our other key requirement for survival and comfort.
The construction materials we use to build our homes can have land use requirements such as growing trees for timber construction, hemp or wood fibre for insulation. Materials such as lime and glass require high temperature production processes, which might require land use for growing biomass energy.

[Section to add here on land use required for building materials: structural timber, hemp, firing lime-kilns, glass production, wood-fibre insulation, see early notes: [hemplime](hemplime) ] 

Any fossil fuel use is of course a complete non starter because because our villagers are aware that this will lead to climate change and that climate change is likely to became one of the leading causes of biodiversity loss over time as well as detrimentally effecting food production due to extreme weather among other impacts.

If our hypothetical households decided to build homes to the average standard of homes in the UK today, the space heating fuel demand would be about 12,700 kWh/year and hot water demand 2280 kWh/year. This is however a modern level of comfort and our hypothetical households might choose to live a lower energy lifestyle, with relatively cold indoor temperatures, working on the smallholdings during the day might also reduce the amount of time spend indoors needing warmth.

The obvious low tech traditional form of heating would be to use wood. If our households choose to heat their homes with Broadleaf Woodland which has an equivalent biomass energy production rate of [0.18 kWh/m2/year](https://learn.openenergymonitor.org/sustainable-energy/energy/renewableheat) to modern levels of comfort each household would need 83,222 m2 of Broadleaf woodland or 9.2x the available land area. That is a worst case biomass heat scenario that is clearly not sustainable for everyone to use. 

A better biomass option would be to use short rotation coppice which has an equivalent biomass energy production rate of [5.66 kWh/m2/year](https://learn.openenergymonitor.org/sustainable-energy/energy/renewableheat). This would require about 2650 m2 or 29% of the land area available for each household.

If our householders decided to reach the average space heating demand target aimed for in ZeroCarbonBritain by insulating, draughtproofing and installing at least secondary glazing, heating energy demand could be reduced by 50% to 6351 kWh/year or 6903 kWh/year after 92% efficient boiler = 1220 m2 (13.6% land area).

If the AECB Silver performance standard was reached the land area would reduce to 11.4%, and if passivhaus standard was reached 7.6%, assuming that the heating demand for hot water stayed constant. It's amazing the range of possible land use for biomass heat with our lowest estimate 120 times less than our largest estimate, all resulting from the choice of coppice vs broadleaf woodland and the thermal performance of the building.

To reach the higher levels of performance a number of high temperature manufacturing processes would be required such as glass manufacture, lime production, iron and steel production for an efficient biomass stove, perhaps even some natural rubber production for air-tight seals. We might assume that passive stack ventilation would be used at this stage rather than active ventilation, so as not to add the requirement for electricity and more advanced technical developments such as motors, pumps & heat exchangers.

Our householders have now a relatively comfortable lifestyle, a warm house, food to eat and plenty of wild nature to explore. There is also a small glass producer, lime kiln, biomass powered iron furnace and iron works. 

**Biodiversity?**

Using biomass for energy means that wood is removed from the land, the wood is not left to fall, die and rot. Fallen trees are an important source of habitat for biodiversity and so there is again a balance here that I wish to understand more thoroughly between extracting the biomass and conserving biodiversity. Example publications:

#### 3. Electricity

To be extended with analysis based on ZeroCarbonBritain 10 year hourly energy modelling, as explored in our [Sustainable Energy section of the OpenEnergyMonitor Learn website](https://learn.openenergymonitor.org/sustainable-energy/energy/introduction).

- Can electrification and zero carbon electricity reduce land requirements for biomass energy?
