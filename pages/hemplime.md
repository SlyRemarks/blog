## title: Hemp Lime Construction
### published: 2018-06-03

Hemp-lime construction provides both load bearing potential, thermal mass and insulation all in one monolithic material.

A 1m2, 300mm thick hemp lime wall with a U-value of 0.21W/m2.K contains 75 kg of lime and 30kg of hemp. 

**Carbon**

Lime is produced at high temperature in a lime kiln from limestone and takes on average 5.3MJ to produce a kg of lime (1.47 kWh/kg). Lime releases 0.48kgCO2/kg when burnt from limestone, it will then reabsorb 25-75% of this 0.48 kgCO2/kg over time. If we assume 50% of the CO2 released in production is reabsorbed then the overall CO2 emissions will be 0.24 kgCO2/kg.

75 kg of lime requires 110 kWh of energy to run the kiln. If the energy to run the kiln is supplied with natural gas the carbon emissions associated with fueling the kiln would be 110 kWh x 0.185 kgCO2/kWh = 20.35 kgCO2. Adding to this the carbon released when turning limestone into lime, 75 kg x 0.24 kgCO2/kg = 18 kgCO2 gives a total of 38.35 kgCO2.

The embodied energy of hemp is around 0.0014 MJ/kg (0.38 Wh/kg, 3786x less than a kg of lime). 30 kg hemp x 0.38 Wh/kg = 0.0114 kWh of processing energy. Growing hemp sequesters carbon, absorbing at most 1.8 kg CO2 per kg of hemp grown (likely much less). If we assume that half the maximum potential carbon sequestration of growing hemp is achieved or 0.9 kgCO2/kg, 30kg of hemp in our 1m2 of hemp lime wall would sequester 27 kgCO2.

Overall 1m2 of 300mm thick hemp lime wall may emit ~11 kgCO2/m2 if the kiln is fuelled by natural gas. If fuelled by biomass the total amount sequestered would be 9 kgCO2/m2. If the setting lime absorbs 75% of the carbon emitted during conversion from limestone and the hemp absorbs the full 1.8 kgCO2/kg, the hemp lime wall would absorb ~25 kgCO2/m2 even when fuelled by natural gas and 45 kgCO2/m2 if the lime kiln is fuelled by biomass. 

It may also be possible to fuel lime kilns with synthetic methane, where CO2 is combined with hydrogen produced from excess renewable electricity via the sabatier process. The CO2 may be provided from biogas (ZeroCarbonBritain) or perhaps even captured as its released from the process of converting limestone to lime in the lime kiln.

**Land use**

3850 kg of hemp hurd are produced per hectare (10,000m2), 30kg of hemp per m2 of wall would therefore require ~12 m2 of land per m2 of wall.

If the 110 kWh of heat energy required by the lime kiln was provided for by short rotation coppice one of the highest energy density biomass crops at 5.66 kWh/m2/year, ~20m2 of land would be required per m2 of wall.

If our building consisted of 140 m2 of wall area (not including openings), a total of 4480 m2 of land would be required for one year to grow the hemp (1680m2) and coppice (2800m2).

If the home lasts 100 years it would need 45m2 of land dedicated to the production and ongoing maintenance of this home - an area roughly similar to the homes physical footprint on the ground and only about 0.5% of UK land area per household.

## Glass

Assuming 10m2 worth of window area and triple glazing. If each pane is 4mm thick and weighs 10.4 kg/m2, our total weight of glass would be roughly 312 kg. The embodied energy of glass is about 15MJ/kg or 4.2 kWh/kg, the total energy requirement would be 1310 kWh. If this heat energy was supplied with short rotation coppice, our glass would require 231 m2 for one year. If the glass lasts 25 years before needing replacement, there would need to be 9.2 m2/household dedicated to glass production.

## Structural timber

If a timber construction is used instead of hemp & lime then the equation is different we no longer need short rotation coppice for firing lime kilns but we do instead need forestry with a certain quality of timber.

The paper [The wood from the trees: The use of timber in construction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032116306050) provides a useful in-depth overview, covering everything from the molecular structure of wood to different uses of wood in construction. The paper gives the following yield figures for UK and Sweden grown timber:

- Sitka spruce grown in the UK, an imported conifer from the Pacific Northwest of North America, can yield 14m3/ha.year. This growth rate is higher than those achieved in its native environment due to the UK's milder climate but the resulting density and structural quality is lower.

- Established forests in southern Sweden yield approximately 10 m3/ha.year or 7 m3/ha.year in the first rotation of a newly planted forest.

On page 349 and 350 the paper gives an example of how much land area is required to grow timber for an apartment in a multi-story timber building. The apartment requires 28 m3 of timber for a 125 m2 apartment.

<div class="quote">
"The total yield of a forest of Norway spruce was found to be around 10 m 3 ha −1 year −1 (Section 2.2), and accounting for the fact that approximately 40% of wood removals from forest go into building and construction (Fig. 27 in Section 9.1), this may be considered to produce at least 4 m 3 ha −1 year −1 of construction products. Each of the three-bedroom apartments described above therefore represents about a year's growth over 7–10 ha. If the building is replaced after 50 years, and the rotation period for the forest is 50 years, then an area of forest of approximately 0.15 to 0.2 ha – a square with 35 or 45 m sides – is required to sustain that accommodation indefinitely"</div>

0.15 to 0.2 ha equates to 1500m2 to 2000m2, or 33 to 44 times the amount of land estimated for hemp lime walls above and ~20% of total land area per household in the UK.

The value of ~40% of wood removals from forest go into building and construction is based on current use of wood globally, 51.6% of wood removal is fuelwood for biomass energy, 48.4% is industrial roundwood (which has 5x the value of fuelwood), 38.1% of total wood removal is for building and construction of which 62% is sawnwood. It's not clear if the total harvestable wood for building and construction could not be a higher proportion if less wood was used for biomass energy. There is likely a quality issue that would limit the portion of wood suitable for building but its not clear what this limit might be.

If it where possibly to use 90% for building and construction it would reduce the total land area requirement for the example apartment down to 600-900m2 or ~8% of total land area per household in the UK. If the timber building lasted twice as long at 100 years, the same lifespan as our hemp&lime example this land area would halve again to 300-450m2 & ~4% of total UK land area per household. This value is still 7-10x the land area estimate for the hemp&lime walls.

I would like to improve on this comparison by creating a basic 3 bedroom house construction model with more accurate estimates for material requirements if built using hemp&lime, timber frame and perhaps other construction methods.

Looking for a second source for forest yields I came across a Forestry Commission handbook: [Forest Yield, A handbook on forest growth and yield tables for British forestry](https://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/FCBK048.pdf/$FILE/FCBK048.pdf). Suggested Scots pine yields are given at 8.4 - 9.9 m3/ha.year for a stand age of 65 years. Sitka spruce 9.4-10.6 m3/ha.year over 49 years. A particular plot in Brendon, Somerset suggests a yield as high as 15.4 m3/ha.year over 57 years.

**Drying**

From the paper: "The wood from the trees: The use of timber in construction":

"There are many methods of removing moisture from timber including air, solvent, microwave and supercritical CO2 drying, but the most common in the sawn softwood industry is convective or condensing kiln drying. Convective drying, although energy and equipment intensive, offers the most accelerated means of drying dimensional timber for market"

"One study has shown that the energy required to kiln dry radiata pine can be 3 GJ/m3 specific heat, three times that of easier to dry species like mixed spruce at approximately 1 GJ/m3"

"Studies in the Pacific Northwest of the United States have shown that of all the manufacturing processes associated with converting roundwood into dimensional timber, kiln drying of softwood consumes the most energy accounting for up to 92% of total manufacturing energy."

1 GJ/m3 is equal to 278 kWh/m3. If the 28m3 apartment example uses kiln dried wood it would require 7800 kWh of drying energy. If this heat energy is provided by short rotation coppice with a biomass energy yield of 5.66 kWh/m2/year, it would require 1374 m2 for one year or 28m2 if the building lasts for 50 years and 14m2 if the building lasts 100 years.
