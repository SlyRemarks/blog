## title: Hemp Lime Construction
### published: 2018-06-03

Hemp-lime construction provides both load bearing potential, thermal mass and insulation all in one monolithic material.

A 1m2, 300mm thick hemp lime wall with a U-value of 0.21W/m2.K contains 75 kg of lime and 30kg of hemp. 

**Carbon**

Lime is produced at high temperature in a lime kiln from limestone and takes on average 5.3MJ to produce a kg of lime (1.47 kWh/kg). Lime releases 0.48kgCO2/kg when burnt from limestone, it will then reabsorb 25-75% of this 0.48 kgCO2/kg over time. If we assume 50% of the CO2 released in production is reabsorbed then the overall CO2 emissions will be 0.24 kgCO2/kg.

75 kg of lime requires 110 kWh of energy to run the kiln. If the energy to run the kiln is supplied with natural gas the carbon emissions associated with fueling the kiln would be 110 kWh x 0.185 kgCO2/kWh = 20.35 kgCO2. Adding to this the carbon released when turning limestone into lime, 75 kg x 0.24 kgCO2/kg = 18 kgCO2 gives a total of 38.35 kgCO2.

The embodied energy of hemp is around 0.0014 MJ/kg (0.38 Wh/kg, 3786x less than a kg of lime). 30 kg hemp x 0.38 Wh/kg = 0.0114 kWh of processing energy. Growing hemp sequesters carbon, absorbing at most 1.8 kg CO2 per kg of hemp grown (likely much less). If we assume that half the maximum potential carbon sequestration of growing hemp is achieved or 0.9 kgCO2/kg, 30kg of hemp in our 1m2 of hemp lime wall would sequester 27 kgCO2.

Overall 1m2 of 300mm thick hemp lime wall may emit ~11 kgCO2/m2 if the kiln is fuelled by natural gas. If fuelled by biomass the total amount sequestered would be 9 kgCO2/m2. If the setting lime absorbs 75% of the carbon emitted during conversion from limestone and the hemp absorbs the full 1.8 kgCO2/kg, the hemp lime wall would absorb ~25 kgCO2/m2 even when fuelled by natural gas and 45 kgCO2/m2 if the lime kiln is fuelled by biomass. 

It may also be possible to fuel lime kilns with synthetic methane, where CO2 is combined with hydrogen produced from excess renewable electricity via the sabatier process. The CO2 may be provided from biogas (ZeroCarbonBritain) or perhaps even captured as its released from the process of converting limestone to lime in the lime kiln.

**Land use**

3850 kg of hemp hurd are produced per hectare (10,000m2), 30kg of hemp per m2 of wall would therefore require ~12 m2 of land per m2 of wall.

If the 110 kWh of heat energy required by the lime kiln was provided for by short rotation coppice one of the highest energy density biomass crops at 5.66 kWh/m2/year, ~20m2 of land would be required per m2 of wall.

If our building consisted of 140 m2 of wall area (not including openings), a total of 4480 m2 of land would be required for one year to grow the hemp (1680m2) and coppice (2800m2).

If the home lasts 100 years it would need 45m2 of land dedicated to the production and ongoing maintenance of this home - an area roughly similar to the homes physical footprint on the ground and only about 0.5% of UK land area per household.

## Glass

Assuming 10m2 worth of window area and triple glazing. If each pane is 4mm thick and weighs 10.4 kg/m2, our total weight of glass would be roughly 312 kg. The embodied energy of glass is about 15MJ/kg or 4.2 kWh/kg, the total energy requirement would be 1310 kWh. If this heat energy was supplied with short rotation coppice, our glass would require 231 m2 for one year. If the glass lasts 25 years before needing replacement, there would need to be 9.2 m2/household dedicated to glass production.

## Structural timber

If a timber construction is used instead of lime then the equation is different we no longer need short rotation coppice for firing lime kilns but we do instead need forestry with a certain quality of timber. Larger trees require large areas and time to grow.

A forestry will grow 10 m3 of timber per hectare per year, 40% of which results in building products = 4 m3 ha year.

150mm x 50mm x 1 = 0.0075
50mm x 50mm x 1 = 0.0025
total = 0.01
x 5 = 0.05

= 0.1 m3 per m2

10,000 m2 

= 250m2 = 2.5m2

160 m2 at 0.1m3 of wood per m2 = 16m3 of wood

15 tonnes of wood  28m3

between 15m3 and 30m3 per house say.

4m3 per hectare per year

house lasts 100 years

400m3 per hectare per 100 years.

So between 375m2 and 750m2 for timber in house.
